Tello_Demo


USE Landmark_version for Demo
I added a pdf. document for the possible commands to give.

This project aimed to create a tello drone which can follow orders in real time.


For now, this project has 3 operatable sketches with 2 different approaches: One with images and one with landmarks which is a script I modified based on another one's.


Images: Pro:
            It can have as many commands as desired.
        Contra:
            Hand recognition fails quite often and wrong commands are given.

Landmarks: Pro:
            Almost always correct recognition.
           Contra:
           Limitation of 9 Commmands.
