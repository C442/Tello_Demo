Tello handgesture recognition

This sketch is used to connect to a tello drone and make it fly with different handgestures.

It has been written by Mayers Christophe, based on the extremely dynamic handsign recognition model of Kinvi(https://github.com/kinivi/hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe). Thank you.

To be able to use it, I recommend downloading following libraries:
csv,copy, argparse, itertools, time, cv2, numpy, mediapipe and djitellopy. 

Downloading and running the "tello_demo" script from the "Tello_Demo" ordner should be sufficient. I added a pdf of all the current commands there are. 

As I have no decades of experience, I am sure you will find some kind of mistakes. I am always open for suggestions of any kind.

It is planned to make this script work for ROS2, to add face tracking and switch from tello camera to computer facecam.
