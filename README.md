Tello_Demo
This project aimed to create a tello drone which can follow orders in real time.

For now, this project has 2 operatable sketches with 2 entirely different approaches: One with images and one with landmarks which is a script I modified based on another one's.


Images: Pro:
            It can have as many commands as desired.
        Contra:
            Hand recognition fails quite often and wrong commands are given.

Landmarks: Pro:
            Almost always correct recognition.
           Contra:
           Limitation of 9 Commmands.
           
There are always pdf documents for the orders you can give the tello.
