Tello_Demo
This project aims to create a tello drone which can follow orders in real time through tello's camera.

Step 1: Giving simple commands to tello to execute

Step 2: Get the videostream of the tello

Step 3: Detect a hand on that stream

Step 4: recognise hand position

Step 5: make it react to the hand's specific position(keras)

Step 6: make it user friendly(like: follow face--> hands stay visible, refine keras algorithm)

We are right now at step 6. 
Tello can follow commands with handgestures. It may starts abrupt, or not at all. It has some problems recognising the correct gestures. It has a better timer and limitations(so, it can avoid resizing errors as much as possible)
