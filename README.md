Tello_Demo
This project aims to create a tello drone which can follow orders in real time through tello's camera.

Step 1: Giving simple commands to tello to execute

Step 2: Get the videostream of the tello

Step 3: Detect a hand on that stream

Step 4: recognise hand position

Step 5: make it react to the hand's specific position(keras)

Step 6: make it user friendly(like: follow face--> hands stay visible, refine keras algorithm)

We are right now at step 5. Tello can follow commands with handgestures. It is sensible, but it works(Tello ordering via commands)
