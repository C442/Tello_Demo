Tello_Demo
This project aims to create a tello drone which can follow orders in real time. 

Step 1: Giving simple commands to tello to execute
Step 2: Get the videostream of the tello
Step 3: Detect a hand on that stream
Step 4: recognise hand position
Step 5: make it react to the hand's specific position(keras)
Step 6: make it user friendly(like: follow face--> hands stay visible, refine keras algorithm)

Depending on perspectiv: we are between 3-4 AND 4-5 at the same time.
3-4: keras model is not working properly
Going from "teachable machine" to normal coding(learning keras)

4-5: using techVidvan's code, I can simply add tello commands(implement phases, so it know when to follow orders) and could then pass on to Step 6.
